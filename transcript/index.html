  <h1>Self-Directed Curriculum</h1>

  <p>This page outlines my self-directed path in Computer Science and Web Technologies. 
  Through years of dedication, self-study, and practical experience, I've built what resembles 
  a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Web Technologies.</p>

  <p>Inspired by programs like OSSU (Open Source Society University), I designed this 
  curriculum to cover essential topics in programming, software development, web technologies, 
  and more, all anchored in real-world application and problem-solving.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned — a full breakdown of the courses and progression will be added here soon.</p>
