  <h1>Curriculum for My Degree</h1>

  <p>
    This curriculum is the result of years of dedication, reflection, and practice. 
    As I pursued mastery in software engineering, web development, and SEO, 
    I discovered that my body of knowledge had grown to resemble a 
    <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Web Technologies</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science" target="_blank">OSSU (Open Source Society University)</a> curriculum 
    and the <em>CS2013 Guidelines</em>, I’ve structured my self-taught degree to meet and exceed the standards of an accredited undergraduate program — 
    with a strong emphasis on real-world skills, applied projects, and ethical development.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page will outline the areas of study, the core and advanced topics, 
    and the unique competencies I’ve developed along this journey.
